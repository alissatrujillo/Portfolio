This is intuitive, as patrons who are seeing movies in theaters are also likely to stream their music. The correlation could possibly go both ways, as consumers who hear songs they enjoy might also be more likely to see the movie it is from. Proving causation in either direction would require additional research into the subject matter."

    "For this project, I collected data from three different sources in order to research popularity and profit of various Walt Disney films. I collected a CSV file, an HTML table, and an API source. I used the tools available to me, including BeautifulSoup and Spotipy, in order to parse this data and turn it into a functional dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course I have learned how to interact with data from novel sources. Using different packages in Python, we are able to collect data from sources that are not nicely formatted CSV files. I learned how to connect to an API and collect necessary information, and I also learned how to visually inspect HTML to find the pieces that I need.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the data was cleaned, it was uploaded into a database using SQL. Each dataset was uploaded individually and then merged into one final dataset to use to perform analysis and create visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main question I was investigating was whether song popularity and film success were correlated with each other. There is a statistically significant positive trend in the data, and we also found correlations between song popularity and film critic scores. I was able to create visualizations to support these claims, as well as some additional visualizations that graphically presented information regarding the individual films and box office profit by year.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets regarding film information are public and there are no ethical implications that would necessarily arise. The third dataset I acquired using the Spotify API does present the possibility of running into complications of that nature. The Spotify API allows us to access a user's profile, liked songs, and much more. For the purposes of this project, no user data was collected, however in a project that did focus on individual users, steps would have to be taken to protect their privacy and ensure that all data was collected consensually."
