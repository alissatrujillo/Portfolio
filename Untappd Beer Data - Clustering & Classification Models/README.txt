The craft beer movement began hundreds of years ago in Europe before arriving overseas to the American frontier. Through the years, we have developed numerous brewing styles, flavor profiles and experimental methods of development. There are hundreds of named “styles” of beer, including fan favorite Lagers and Stouts, as well as more niche entires such as Wee Heavies and Smoke Beers.

Our friends over at Untapped provide an incredible look into data regarding beer style, popularity and intrinsic characteristics. They provide taste profiling information such as maltiness, hoppiness, fruitiness and many more. We will be using this data to experiment with two different types of models.

The first will be a clustering model that aims to discover how beer is most naturally classified, creating the most distinct clusters to provide insights into simialrities between styles and tasting profiles.

The second will be a decision tree classification model. This model will take into account the qualities associated with 43 different styles of beers (that sounds like a lot! And that is after quite a bit of condensation) and it will attempt to classify new beers based on only their intrinsic qualities.

Both of these models will give us insights to understand consumer habits and provide the framework to eventually create a recommendation system to assist users in finding their new favorite brew.
