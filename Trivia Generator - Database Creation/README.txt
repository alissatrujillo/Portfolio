Trvia nights are a fundamental American past-time, allowing friendly competition between friends and family for giftcards, free pints, and the like. Many local venues host trivia events weekly, and they provide a great way to try new local spots and support local businesses.

This tool aims to take the hard work out of planning trivia events. This trivia generator will allow the user to set their preferences, including categories, difficulty, and the length of the game. The system then searches the database for questions that match the criteria and provides the host with a sheet with all the details they need to put on a successful event.

Try the generator yourself! Pick your favorite topic and give it a go.
