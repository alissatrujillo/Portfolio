Do you ever scroll through Netflix endlessly, trying to figure out what to watch?

The good news is you are not alone. With all of the options at our fingertips, it is harder than ever to decide which films and television shows should be next on your watchlist. This app provides recommendations based on the films you already like.

This app sources its data from the MovieLens Dataset. This dataset provides a huge database of user movie reviews. The recommendation system takes into account a user's likes as well as the other movies they have liked or disliked. This allows it to compare similarity between films and develop a taste profile for each user.

After inputting your favorite film, you will be provided a list of movies that users who enjoyed your favorite mvovie also rated highly. The movies in the system were vetted to ensure that each movie had been reviewed by at least 100 patrons so that the statistics were not skewed by a single positive or negative review.

This interactive recommender allows you as the user to input your favorite movie to see what you should watch next! Go ahead and give it a try.
