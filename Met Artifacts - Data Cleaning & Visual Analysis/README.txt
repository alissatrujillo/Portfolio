The Metropolitan Museum of Art has an incredible collection of artifacts from all over the globe. We will explore their ever-expanding catalogue of art, sculptures and historical figures through a number of stunning visuals.

The Met has an open source CSV file that is constantly updated with new artifacts as they join the collection. We will take a look at the current catalogue as of Fall 2023, looking at the Met as a snapshot in time.

What types of artifacts are most common throughout the museum? What are the different collections, and how are they distributed? We will answer these questions and more during our data exploration and visualization process.
