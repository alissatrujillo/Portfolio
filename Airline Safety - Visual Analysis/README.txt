There has recently been a surge in news coverage regarding a decline in Airline safety, reliability and affordability. It is at the forefront of consumers' minds to find travel options that will get them to their destinations in a safe and timely manner. The news media is perpetrating the idea that air travel is significantly less safe and reliable than it was the past. We will take a look at whether these claims are actually true and backed up by the statistics.

For this project, I have created a few different multimedia presentations that aim to answer this question. The first is an infographic detailing safety statistics of air travel, as well as comparisons between it and other modes of transport. It further discusses the incidence of safety incidents and the number of air miles flown every year. This is a quick and easily consumable graphic that gets across the most pertinent information in a quick glance.

The second presentation is a PowerPoint which presents internal statistics to the board of the Alaska Airlines Company. It overviews the summary statistics of air safety for all carriers, then discusses the comparisons between Alaska Airline's own data versus the baseline. This presentation is aimed at a more knowledgeable audience so it contains more technical details such as carrier models and individual crash reports.

The third presentation is in video format, presenting in a more compelling way to catch the attention of general audiences using storytelling elements. It discusses the sensationalized media claims regarding air travel in a fast-paced, mythbusting format to appeal to a wider selection of consumers. This video uses real-life data to prove or disprove the media claims, backing them up with simple yet effective information. This easy-to-digest information allows consumers to make educated and confident decisions about travel this summer and for the upcoming holiday season.

This project uses the principles of data storytelling to take a wealth of statistical information and relay it to audiences in a concise and aesthetically-pleasing way. The various modes of presentation allow for stories to be told in different manners to different audiences.
