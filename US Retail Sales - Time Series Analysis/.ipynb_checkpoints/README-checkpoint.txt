This project takes a look at US Retail sales over the last few decades. There are noticeable ups and downs over the years, with the occurence of a major recession and a global pandemic. The sales trends tend to follow closely along with the state of the economy.

In addition to greater global trends, there are also yearly seasonal trends in sales. We frequently see higher sales around the holidays and lower sales in the spring. Are these fluctuations statistically significant? And how do they compare to the greater year by year trends?

This project aims to create a timeseries analysis that dives into these trends, and ultimately predicts trends of future cycles.
