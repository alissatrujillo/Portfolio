Big Brother US is an American reality show that premiered in 2000 where houseguests of all different backgrounds are living together in a house cut off from the outside world. These contestants are competing for $500,000-$750,000 over the course of the summer. They play competitions to win power and leverage, and make social connections in order to ensure they are protected by their fellow players. So what makes a good big brother player?

This project will take a look at which characteristics are shared amongst past winners as well as those who did well in the game but failed to win. Are there specific demographics that tend to do better in the game? Which demographics are overrepresented and underrepresented?

We will also look at some of the myths that surround the game, such as the "first to enter" curse. Why has the first person to enter the house during the premiere never won the game? Is this a statistical anomaly?

Is there any statistically significant and sound advice we can give houseguests entering the house for the summer? Can we predict who will win a future season using this model?

Let's take a look. And remember, Big Brother is always watching.
